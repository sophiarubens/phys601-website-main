## Projects

At the moment, two projects I'm working on are an inverse power spectrum calculator and a computational physics problem set.

- My [inverse power spectrum calculator](./python_project/ips.ipynb) will come in handy as I continue to work with short-baseline 21 cm interferometric data. This is an old version of my code with several known bugs and inefficiencies. Once my latest version is stable, I'll update the notebook linked here. 
- On one recent assignment for PHYS 512 (computational physics), I ran some MCMC simulations to estimate uncertainty in Lambda-CDM cosmological parameters. To reflect a prior on the tau parameter, I compared the effects of importance sampling to those of running a constrained chain. I discuss this in more detail [here](./data_project/index.md).
