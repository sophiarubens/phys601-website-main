## Projects

At the moment, two projects I'm working on are an inverse power spectrum calculator and a computational physics problem set.

- My [inverse power spectrum calculator](./python_project/ips.ipynb) will come in handy as I continue to work with short-baseline 21 cm interferometric data.
- My current computational physics problem set is on Fourier transforms, but I'm still working on it. On my last assignment for PHYS 512, I ran some MCMC simulations to estimate uncertainty in Lambda-CDM cosmological parameters. To reflect a prior on the tau parameter, I compared the effects of importance sampling to those of running a constrained chain. I discuss this in more detail [here](./data_project/index.md).
