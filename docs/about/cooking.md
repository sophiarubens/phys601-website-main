# Improvisation and synthesis

Some recent highlights have been

* Argentine x Georgian: empanadas de fugazzeta in a mkhlovani form factor
* Korean x Italian: homemade gnocchi with banchan
* Persian x diner: chocolate–tahini–preserved lime muffins
* Indian x Levantine: paratha dough and technique, but layered with za'atar and olive oil instead of ghee and cumin
