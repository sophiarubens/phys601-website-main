# Introduction

Sophia Rubens is a first-year direct-entry doctoral student at McGill University whose longtime interests in understanding the fundamental workings of the universe have led her to radio cosmology. She graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in 2024 with an A.B. in Physics (thesis with high honors) and minor in astronomy. Currently, she works with Adrian Liu and Cynthia Chiang at the intersection of cosmology theory-computation and instrumentation-observation. She is working towards characterizing systematics in 21 cm hydrogen intensity mapping data from the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) by preparing cosmological forecasts and examining galaxy cross-correlations. 

Sophia's journey towards studying cosmology at the [Trottier Space Institute (TSI)](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) was informed by distilling and re-articulating her research interests during her undergraduate studies. In 2020, her plan upon entering undergraduate studies was to pursue both chemistry and astronomy. Although conducting [computational chemistry research on semiconducting polymers](https://www.wzdartmouth.com/people) proved an enriching intellectual experience, Sophia realized that she was more inspired to learn about the larger scales of space than the microscales of molecules and atoms. 

After conducting [heliospheric physics research](https://heliosphere.host.dartmouth.edu/people.htm) during 2022 and 2023, Sophia realized that she was more interested in larger spatial scales and big-picture understandings of the universe. Subsequently, Sophia became enthralled with radio astronomy while participating in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at MIT Haystack Observatory. Her project, characterizing the gravitationally lensed blazar using very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging, single-dish molecular line identification, and periodicity analysis of multiwavelength light curves. Sophia continued developing this work into an undergraduate thesis, and applied to graduate school with the idea of diving further into radio astronomy but connecting more directly with the cosmological big picture of her undergraduate work.

Sophia has presented her work at several home institution poster sessions, the [243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AAS...24310419K/abstract), and the end-of-program symposium at MIT Haystack Observatory. She also works with students, such as working as a teaching assistant both at Dartmouth College and McGill University and working as a peer tutor at Dartmouth College and Exeter High School in Exeter, New Hampshire. Sophia also enjoys conducting physics outreach as a volunteer at TSI. For more information, please consult [Sophia's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-rubens-798183200/).
