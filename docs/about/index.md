## Introduction

I'm a first-year direct-entry doctoral student at McGill University. My longtime interests in understanding the fundamental workings of the universe have led me to radio cosmology. I graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in 2024 with an A.B. in Physics (thesis with high honors) and minor in astronomy. Currently, I work with [Adrian Liu](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~acliu/Research.html) and [Cynthia Chiang](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/) at the intersection of cosmology theory-computation and instrumentation-observation. I'm working towards characterizing systematics in 21 cm hydrogen intensity mapping data from the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector (CHORD) by preparing cosmological forecasts and examining galaxy cross-correlations. 

My journey towards studying cosmology at the [Trottier Space Institute (TSI)](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/) at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) was informed by distilling and re-articulating my research interests during my undergraduate studies. In 2020, my plan upon entering undergraduate studies was to pursue both chemistry and astronomy. Although conducting [computational chemistry research on semiconducting polymers](https://www.wzdartmouth.com/people) proved an enriching intellectual experience, I realized I was more inspired to learn about the larger scales of space than the microscales of molecules and atoms. 

After conducting [heliospheric physics research](https://heliosphere.host.dartmouth.edu/people.htm) during 2022 and 2023, I realized I was more interested in larger spatial scales and big-picture understandings of the universe. Subsequently, I became enthralled with radio astronomy while participating in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at MIT Haystack Observatory. My project consisted of characterizing the gravitationally lensed blazar using very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging, single-dish molecular line identification, and periodicity analysis of multiwavelength light curves. I continued developing this work into an undergraduate thesis, and applied to graduate school with the idea of diving further into radio astronomy but connecting more directly with the cosmological big picture of her undergraduate work.

I have presented my work at several home institution poster sessions, the [243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AAS...24310419K/abstract), and the end-of-program symposium at MIT Haystack Observatory. I also enjoy working with students, such as in my capacities as a teaching assistant both at Dartmouth College and McGill University and working as a peer tutor at Dartmouth College and Exeter High School in Exeter, New Hampshire. I also enjoy conducting physics outreach as a volunteer at TSI. For more information, please consult [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-rubens-798183200/).
