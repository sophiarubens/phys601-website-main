## Research

As a researcher, I live at the boundary between theoretical—in the sense of simulations, forecasting, and modeling—and experimental—to the tune of telescope dish troubleshooting—cosmology. I work with one supervisor in each realm and communicate with both groups. At the moment, seeing as it is still merely my second month as a graduate student, I am laying the groundwork for my future thesis project more than working on a fully-fledged project itself. 

So far, I have written codes to (1) translate a cosmological brightness temperature fluctuation box to a power spectrum, (2) construct such a box as a random realization of the statistics encoded in a power spectrum, and (3) construct Fisher matrices for selected objective functions of interest. Before I undertake my preliminary thesis examination during the Winter 2026 term, I will fully model at least one systematic in CHORD data, including preparing cosmological forecasts using the Fisher matrix formalism and a galaxy cross-correlation analysis. I will extend this line of inquiry as my studies progress and as first light for the CHORD telescope arrives. 

I don't yet have any papers in peer-reviewed journals, so below I'll link the two most significant reports I've prepared.
